**0. Current Working Directory & Objective Image Description:**

*   **Current Working Directory (CWD):** `/app`
*   **Objective Image Description:** No architecture diagrams or images were provided in the input. The analysis will solely rely on configuration files.

**I. Project Overview & Key Configuration File Identification:**

*   **Workspace Path Confirmed:** `/data/mall_code`

*   **Initial README Scan for Deployment Clues:**
    The `README.md` file indicates that this is a `mall` e-commerce project, implemented with Spring Boot and MyBatis, and designed for Docker containerization. It mentions that `mall-admin` is the backend management system and `mall-portal` is the frontend e-commerce system. It also explicitly lists key technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring Security, MyBatis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Redis, MongoDB, Nginx, and Docker. The README also references Docker Compose for deployment.

*   **Key Configuration Files Identified:**
    Based on the `find` commands, the following key configuration files are identified:

    *   **Dockerfiles:**
        *   `/data/mall_code/document/sh/Dockerfile`
    *   **Docker Compose:**
        *   `/data/mall_code/document/docker/docker-compose-app.yml` (Likely for application services)
        *   `/data/mall_code/document/docker/docker-compose-env.yml` (Likely for environment services like databases, etc.)
    *   **Spring Boot Application Properties (YAML):**
        *   `/data/mall_code/mall-admin/src/main/resources/application.yml`
        *   `/data/mall_code/mall-admin/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`

    *   **Nginx:**
        *   `/data/mall_code/document/docker/nginx.conf`

**II. Containerization Analysis (Docker):**

*   **Dockerfile Analysis:**
    The Dockerfile `/data/mall_code/document/sh/Dockerfile` (likely for `mall-admin`) shows:
    *   **Base Image:** `openjdk:8`
    *   **EXPOSEd Port:** `8080`
    *   **CMD/ENTRYPOINT:** `java -jar /mall-admin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
    *   This indicates a Spring Boot application, likely `mall-admin`, packaged as a JAR and exposing port 8080.

*   **Docker Compose Analysis:**
    *   **`/data/mall_code/document/docker/docker-compose-env.yml`:** Defines the environment services.
        *   **Services Defined:** `mysql`, `redis`, `nginx`, `rabbitmq`, `elasticsearch`, `logstash`, `kibana`, `mongo`, `minio`.
        *   **Port Mappings:**
            *   `mysql`: `3306:3306` (host 3306 -> container 3306)
            *   `redis`: `6379:6379` (host 6379 -> container 6379)
            *   `nginx`: `80:80` (host 80 -> container 80)
            *   `rabbitmq`: `5672:5672`, `15672:15672` (host 5672 -> container 5672, host 15672 -> container 15672 for management UI)
            *   `elasticsearch`: `9200:9200`, `9300:9300` (host 9200 -> container 9200, host 9300 -> container 9300)
            *   `logstash`: `4560:4560`, `4561:4561`, `4562:4562`, `4563:4563` (host 4560-4563 -> container 4560-4563)
            *   `kibana`: `5601:5601` (host 5601 -> container 5601)
            *   `mongo`: `27017:27017` (host 27017 -> container 27017)
            *   `minio`: `9090:9000`, `9001:9001` (host 9090 -> container 9000, host 9001 -> container 9001 for console)
        *   **Networks:** No custom networks explicitly defined; default bridge network is implied.
        *   **Dependencies (`depends_on`):** `logstash` depends on `elasticsearch`, `kibana` depends on `elasticsearch`.
        *   **Links (`links`):** `logstash` links `elasticsearch` as `es`, `kibana` links `elasticsearch` as `es`. These provide internal DNS resolution.

    *   **`/data/mall_code/document/docker/docker-compose-app.yml`:** Defines the application services.
        *   **Services Defined:** `mall-admin`, `mall-search`, `mall-portal`.
        *   **Port Mappings:**
            *   `mall-admin`: `8080:8080` (host 8080 -> container 8080)
            *   `mall-search`: `8081:8081` (host 8081 -> container 8081)
            *   `mall-portal`: `8085:8085` (host 8085 -> container 8085)
        *   **Networks:** No custom networks explicitly defined; default bridge network is implied.
        *   **External Links (`external_links`):**
            *   `mall-admin`: links `mysql` as `db`.
            *   `mall-search`: links `elasticsearch` as `es`, `mysql` as `db`.
            *   `mall-portal`: links `redis` as `redis`, `mongo` as `mongo`, `mysql` as `db`, `rabbitmq` as `rabbit`. These links imply that these application services are expected to communicate with the corresponding databases/message queues using these aliased hostnames.

**III. Reverse Proxy / API Gateway Analysis (Nginx):**

*   **Nginx Configuration Analysis:**
    The `nginx.conf` file located at `/data/mall_code/document/docker/nginx.conf` shows a basic Nginx configuration:
    *   **Listen Port:** `80`
    *   **Server Name:** `localhost`
    *   **Root Directory:** `/usr/share/nginx/html` for the default `/` location.
    *   **Absence of `proxy_pass` directives:** This Nginx configuration, as provided, does **not** contain any `proxy_pass` directives to route traffic to backend application services like `mall-admin`, `mall-search`, or `mall-portal`. It appears to be configured solely for serving static HTML content. This implies that if these application services are to be publicly accessible via Nginx, additional proxy configurations would be required, which are not present in this `nginx.conf`. The `docker-compose-app.yml` shows direct port mappings for the application services, suggesting they might be directly accessible as well, or another Nginx configuration is intended.

**IV. Determined Public Exposure & Internal Network Topology:**

*   **Publicly Exposed Entry Points:**
    Based on the analyzed `docker-compose.yml` files, the following services appear to be directly exposed to the host machine's network interface (defaulting to 0.0.0.0, or all interfaces), thereby being potentially publicly exposed if proper firewall rules are not in place:
    *   **Nginx:** Host Port `80` -> Container Port `80`. Serves static content.
    *   **MySQL:** Host Port `3306` -> Container Port `3306`. (Typically only internally accessible, but configured for direct host exposure).
    *   **Redis:** Host Port `6379` -> Container Port `6379`. (Typically only internally accessible, but configured for direct host exposure).
    *   **RabbitMQ:** Host Port `5672` -> Container Port `5672` (AMQP), Host Port `15672` -> Container Port `15672` (Management UI). (Typically only internally accessible, but configured for direct host exposure).
    *   **Elasticsearch:** Host Port `9200` -> Container Port `9200` (HTTP), Host Port `9300` -> Container Port `9300` (Transport). (Typically only internally accessible, but configured for direct host exposure).
    *   **Kibana:** Host Port `5601` -> Container Port `5601`. (Typically only internally accessible, but configured for direct host exposure).
    *   **MongoDB:** Host Port `27017` -> Container Port `27017`. (Typically only internally accessible, but configured for direct host exposure).
    *   **MinIO:** Host Port `9090` -> Container Port `9000` (MinIO API), Host Port `9001` -> Container Port `9001` (MinIO Console). (Configured for direct host exposure).
    *   **mall-admin:** Host Port `8080` -> Container Port `8080`.
    *   **mall-search:** Host Port `8081` -> Container Port `8081`.
    *   **mall-portal:** Host Port `8085` -> Container Port `8085`.

    **Important Note on Nginx:** The provided `nginx.conf` does not proxy to `mall-admin`, `mall-search`, or `mall-portal`. Therefore, if Nginx is intended as the primary public entry point for these applications, its configuration is incomplete. The applications are, however, directly exposed via their own host port mappings.

*   **Internal Service Connectivity:**
    Internal services communicate primarily via Docker's default bridge network and its DNS resolution.
    *   `mall-admin` connects to `mysql` using the Docker DNS name `db` (aliased from `mysql` service) on its internal port `3306`.
    *   `mall-search` connects to `elasticsearch` using the Docker DNS name `es` (aliased from `elasticsearch` service) on its internal port `9200` and `mysql` using `db` on port `3306`.
    *   `mall-portal` connects to `redis` using `redis` on port `6379`, `mongo` using `mongo` on port `27017`, `mysql` using `db` on port `3306`, and `rabbitmq` using `rabbit` on port `5672`.
    *   `logstash` connects to `elasticsearch` using the Docker DNS name `es` on its internal port `9200`.
    *   `kibana` connects to `elasticsearch` using the Docker DNS name `es` on its internal port `9200`.
    *   Applications will look for data sources as configured in their `application.yml` files (e.g., `spring.datasource.url`).
        *   Example `application.yml` for `mall-admin` (assuming `application-dev.yml` or `application.yml` active):
            *   `spring.datasource.url` would likely point to `jdbc:mysql://db:3306/...`
        *   Example `application.yml` for `mall-search`:
            *   `spring.data.elasticsearch.uris` would likely point to `http://es:9200`
            *   `spring.datasource.url` would likely point to `jdbc:mysql://db:3306/...`
        *   Example `application.yml` for `mall-portal`:
            *   `spring.data.redis.host` would likely point to `redis`
            *   `spring.data.mongodb.uri` would likely point to `mongodb://mongo:27017/...`
            *   `spring.rabbitmq.host` would likely point to `rabbit`
            *   `spring.datasource.url` would likely point to `jdbc:mysql://db:3306/...`

*   **Network Exposure Guideline Adherence:**
    The public exposures listed are based on direct Docker host port mappings found in `docker-compose-env.yml` and `docker-compose-app.yml`. While Nginx is present, its current configuration does not route traffic to the application services, thus the direct application port mappings are identified as potential public entry points. Services behind Nginx (if it were configured for proxying) or those only exposed within the Docker network through
    `external_links` are considered internal. Standard firewall practices (ports other than 80/443/22 etc. on a server are typically firewalled by default unless explicitly opened by infrastructure or cloud security groups not visible here) are assumed, so only explicitly configured public pathways are reported as such. The database and other backend services are exposed directly on the host, which is a common setup for local development but less common for production without additional network segmentation.

*   **Data Store Connectivity:**
    As inferred from `external_links` in `docker-compose-app.yml` and common Spring Boot patterns, application services connect to data stores using Docker service names (effectively internal DNS names) within the Docker network.
    *   `mall-admin` connects to `mysql` (via `db` alias) on port `3306`.
    *   `mall-search` connects to `elasticsearch` (via `es` alias) on port `9200` and `mysql` (via `db` alias) on port `3306`.
    *   `mall-portal` connects to `redis` (via `redis` alias) on port `6379`, `mongo` (via `mongo` alias) on port `27017`, `mysql` (via `db` alias) on port `3306`, and `rabbitmq` (via `rabbit` alias) on port `5672`.
    These hostnames are internal to the Docker network. Their respective ports are hardcoded in the `docker-compose-env.yml` configuration (e.g., MySQL on `3306`, Redis on `6379`, MongoDB on `27017`, Elasticsearch on `9200`, RabbitMQ on `5672`).
